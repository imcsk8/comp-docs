# Lightweight Hosting with LXC and CentOS 9

## Install LXC + LibVirt

CentOS 9 Stream does not ship the `libvirt-daemon-lxc` and `libvirt-daemon-driver-lxc` driver.
Download the SRPM package from Fedora https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=2267746

Install the SRPM and edit the spec file. In the spec file set the `with_lxc` variable to 1.

```
# RHEL doesn't ship many hypervisor drivers
%if 0%{?rhel}
    %define with_openvz 0
    %define with_vbox 0
    %define with_vmware 0
    %define with_libxl 0
    %define with_hyperv 0
    %define with_vz 0
    %define with_lxc 1
%endif
```
